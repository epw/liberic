This repository stores my libraries for various languages. They are
broken up by language and by toolkit.

Any given directory will contain a Makefile. Running
    $ make all
will compile if necessary, and otherwise build the library in the
current directory.

Running
    $ make install
will install the library to the proper directories under ROOT
(defaults to /usr/local).
